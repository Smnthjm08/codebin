### Project Breakdown

- React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js with Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Socket.io/WebSocket.

1. **Set Up Monorepo (Optional but Recommended):**
   - [ ] Initialize a monorepo using `Nx`, `Turborepo`, or `Lerna` to manage both the frontend and backend.

2. **Initialize Frontend:**
   - [X] Create a React app using Vite or Create React App.
   - [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS.
   - [ ] Set up routing with `react-router-dom` for different pages like Home, Snippet Editor, and User Profile.
   - [ ] Set up state management using React Context API, Redux Toolkit, or Zustand.

3. **Initialize Backend:**
   - [ ] Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - [ ] Install Prisma ORM and initialize it with a PostgreSQL database.
   - [ ] Set up environment variables for database connection and secrets.

4. **Set Up Database:**
   - [ ] Install and configure PostgreSQL locally or use a managed service.
   - [ ] Define Prisma models for `User`, `Snippet`, `Tag`, `Folder`, `Collection`, and `Version`.
   - [ ] Run `prisma migrate dev` to generate and apply database migrations.

### User Authentication and Authorization

5. **Backend:**
   - [ ] Set up authentication routes in Express (e.g., `/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`, `/auth/logout`).
   - [ ] Integrate OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.) using Passport.js or NextAuth.js.
   - [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication for protected routes.

6. **Frontend:**
   - [ ] Create authentication pages (Login, Signup).
   - [ ] Set up context or global state for managing user authentication status.
   - [ ] Add OAuth buttons for GitHub, Google, etc.

### Snippet Management

7. **Backend:**
   - [ ] Create CRUD routes for snippets (`/api/snippets`).
   - [ ] Add support for snippet visibility options (Public, Private, Unlisted).
   - [ ] Implement versioning for snippets using Prisma relations.

8. **Frontend:**
   - [ ] Build a **Snippet Editor** component using Monaco Editor or CodeMirror.
   - [ ] Create a page for snippet creation and editing.
   - [ ] Add options for syntax highlighting and selecting the snippet language.
   - [ ] Implement tagging and categorization features.

### Real-Time Collaboration

9. **Backend:**
   - [ ] Set up Socket.io with Express to handle real-time connections.
   - [ ] Create events for collaborative editing (e.g., `joinRoom`, `leaveRoom`, `editSnippet`, `comment`).

10. **Frontend:**
    - [ ] Install and configure Socket.io client.
    - [ ] Add real-time collaborative editing features in the Snippet Editor component.
    - [ ] Show active collaborators and their cursors in real-time.

### Folder and Collection Management

11. **Backend:**
    - [ ] Create Prisma models for `Folder` and `Collection`.
    - [ ] Implement endpoints for managing folders and collections (CRUD operations).

12. **Frontend:**
    - [ ] Build a **Folder/Collection Manager** component.
    - [ ] Implement drag-and-drop functionality for organizing snippets into folders.
    - [ ] Allow sharing of collections with other users.

### Search and Tagging System

13. **Backend:**
    - [ ] Implement search endpoints for snippets based on tags, titles, or content.
    - [ ] Use Prisma's filtering and search capabilities or integrate **Elasticsearch** for full-text search.

14. **Frontend:**
    - [ ] Create a **Search Bar** component with autocomplete suggestions.
    - [ ] Add filtering options to search snippets by language, tags, and user.

### Version Control

15. **Backend:**
    - [ ] Create version management endpoints to retrieve, compare, and revert versions.
    - [ ] Implement a diff tool for comparing different versions of snippets.

16. **Frontend:**
    - [ ] Build a **Version History** component to display snippet versions.
    - [ ] Implement a diff viewer to compare changes between versions.

### Notifications and Comments

17. **Backend:**
    - [ ] Implement Socket.io events for real-time notifications.
    - [ ] Create routes for managing comments (`/api/comments`).

18. **Frontend:**
    - [ ] Add a **Notification System** to handle real-time updates.
    - [ ] Create a **Comments Section** for each snippet with support for inline comments.

### API Development

19. **Backend:**
    - [ ] Develop a RESTful API or GraphQL API using Express for all the core functionalities.
    - [ ] Secure API endpoints with JWT-based authentication.
    - [ ] Write documentation for the API using Swagger or Postman.

20. **Frontend:**
    - [ ] Use **React Query** or **SWR** for data fetching, caching, and state synchronization with the backend.
    - [ ] Create reusable hooks for API calls.

### Deployment

21. **Prepare for Deployment:**
    - [ ] Dockerize both the frontend and backend applications.
    - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or other tools.
  
22. **Deploy the Application:**
    - [ ] Deploy the frontend to Vercel, Netlify, or similar services.
    - [ ] Deploy the backend to AWS, DigitalOcean, or Heroku.
    - [ ] Deploy PostgreSQL on a managed database service like AWS RDS or DigitalOcean Managed Databases.

23. **Monitor and Optimize:**
    - [ ] Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.
    - [ ] Optimize database queries and API response times.

### Additional Features

24. **Add Extra Features:**
    - [ ] Implement snippet embedding and shareable links.
    - [ ] Add Markdown support for documentation snippets.
    - [ ] Integrate analytics to track snippet usage and performance.

### Final Touches

25. **Testing:**
    - [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library for the frontend.
    - [ ] Use Mocha, Chai, or Jest for backend testing.
    - [ ] Perform end-to-end testing using Cypress or Playwright.

26. **Documentation:**
